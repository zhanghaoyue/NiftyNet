# Deep Boosted Regression 

In order to train a neural network as in [1] you can add your data to a folder such as `/home/foo/data/` and then run the following line

`python net_run.py train -c niftynet/contrib/deep_boosted_regression/net_DBR.ini -a niftynet.contrib.deep_boosted_regression.regression_rec_application.RegressionRecApplication`
